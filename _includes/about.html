        <p><strong>The Bell/Quillen Family Team</strong><br>
        Four Coaches. One Mission. Millions of Lives Transformed.</p>

        <p>In the Bell-Quillen family, coaching isn't just a profession—it's a calling. Together, Dan and Mary Bell, Allison Bell Quillen, and Ralph Quillen bring decades of experience, a shared passion for helping others, and a legacy of leadership that spans both business and personal transformation.</p>

        <p><strong>Dan &amp; Mary Bell</strong><br>
        From the very beginning of OPTAVIA's journey—through its predecessor, Take Shape for Life—Dan Bell helped architect the company's business model, compensation plan, and foundational training programs. His vision has touched millions of lives across the U.S. Alongside him, Mary Bell provided the support, wisdom, and grounding influence that kept their mission people-centered, while also building a rich life focused on family, creativity, and health.</p>

        <p><strong>Allison Bell Quillen</strong><br>
        Carrying forward her parents' legacy while forging her own path, Allison served as Vice President of Field Alignment &amp; Activation for OPTAVIA, bridging corporate strategy with the field and creating powerful experiences for Coaches nationwide. Known for her ability to inspire, connect, and execute, she has shaped programs and events that strengthened OPTAVIA's culture of recognition and engagement. Allison saw the bigger picture—that true freedom and fulfillment meant following in her parents' footsteps, so she left her corporate role and has now embraced coaching full time.</p>

        <p><strong>Ralph Quillen</strong><br>
        A longtime lacrosse coach and mentor, Ralph has spent years developing young athletes into responsible citizens and emerging leaders. Now returning to OPTAVIA Coaching, he brings his dedication to personal growth and his talent for building relationships to the family business—expanding the reach of the Bell-Quillen mission.</p>

        <p><strong>One Team, One Vision</strong><br>
        Together, the Bell-Quillen family represents over 100 years of combined leadership and coaching experience, united by a single purpose: to help others achieve optimal health in body, mind, and finances. Their collective work has already impacted millions—and they're just getting started.</p>
